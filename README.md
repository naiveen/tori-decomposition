Include block.h, block.cpp, graph.h, maxflow.cpp, instances.inc as source files on visual studio in order to avoid compilation errors. Or comment the function "cut_graph" and the line "#include "graph.h" to visualize just the fundamental cycles.

# libigl example project

A blank project example showing how to use libigl and cmake. Feel free and
encouraged to copy or fork this project as a way of starting a new personal
project using libigl.

## See the tutorial first

Then build, run and understand the [libigl
tutorial](http://libigl.github.io/libigl/tutorial/).

## Dependencies

The only dependencies are STL, Eigen, [libigl](http://libigl.github.io/libigl/) and the dependencies
of the `igl::opengl::glfw::Viewer` (OpenGL, glad and GLFW).
The CMake build system will automatically download libigl and its dependencies using
[CMake FetchContent](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html),
thus requiring no setup on your part.

To use a local copy of libigl rather than downloading the repository via FetchContent, you can use
the CMake cache variable `FETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_LIBIGL` when configuring your CMake project for
the first time:
```
cmake -DFETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_LIBIGL=<path-to-libigl> ..
```
When changing this value, do not forget to clear your `CMakeCache.txt`, or to update the cache variable
via `cmake-gui` or `ccmake`.

## Compile

Compile this project using the standard cmake routine:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

This should find and build the dependencies and create a `example_bin` binary.

On Windows,
From Visual Studio, open tori.sln file in build/.
Right click on Solution, change starting project to tori.  


## Run

From within the `build` directory just issue:

    ./tori

A glfw app should launch displaying fundamental cycles on fertitlity mesh.
